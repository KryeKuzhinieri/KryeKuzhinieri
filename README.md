### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Open-source projects are a clear proof that people can learn, work, and improve themselves by cooperating with one another. It is for this reason that I have decided to post all my work here. So, if you have a question related to my repositories, please send me an email by clicking [here](mailto:kryekuzhinieri@gmail.com). 

Further, here are some **fun** facts about me:

- :cookie: I love cooking but I hate washing the dishes.
- :rage: Chess is my favorite game until the moment I start loosing matches.
- :yum:	Although I like talking to people, I prefer working from home.
- :runner: I love running long distances but not marathons.
