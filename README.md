### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I post my projects on Github because I learned programming using the open source services that I found online. Hence, if you have a question related to my repositories, please send me an email by clicking [here](mailto:eness.188@live.de). 

Further, here are some **fun** facts about me:

- :cookie: I love cooking but I hate washing the dishes.
- :rage: Chess is my favorite game until the moment I start loosing matches.
- :yum:	Although I like talking to people, I prefer working from home.
- :blue_heart: I am stubborn but with a big heart.
